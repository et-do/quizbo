To deploy changes to firebase either:

```
- Merge to main/
  OR
- run `npm run build` then `firebase deploy`
```

Common issues:

- Don't forget to put a firebase.js in src

For more styling:

```
npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

Deploy `maintenance.html` when needing to pause hosting
